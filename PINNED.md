## Who I Am

Vision Architect. Product Builder. Systems Thinker.

I design and build products that help people ascend from confusion to 
strategic clarity.

## What I Build

### 🦅 Ascent Ledger (Current Project)
AI-powered career mentorship tool that provides:
- External perspective (see your blind spots)
- Decision frameworks (navigate choices strategically)
- Strategic guidance (mentor-level wisdom, always available)

**Tech Stack:** React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, OpenAI API, Tailwind CSS  
**Status:** Validation complete (6 interviews), MVP launching April 2026  
**Positioning:** What a $500/hour mentor gives you, but accessible ($10-50/month)

### 🦅 E.A.G.L.E. Framework
My operating system for building products from fog → validated → launched.

**Phases:**

- **Phase 2: Architect** → System Design
- **Phase 3: Generate** → Build MVP
- **Phase 4: Launch & Lead** → Go-to-Market
- **Phase 5: Evolve** → Continuous Improvement

## My Approach
